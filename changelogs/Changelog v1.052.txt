- Fixed a bug where 1.995 seconds would be parsed as "1:00" instead of "2:00"
- userIDs now are trimmed down such that they do not contain leading or trailing whitespaces (will cause bugs...)
- hidden loading screen (press and hold "register online")
- stacking map screens (small workaround - instantly call gameEnd(false) instead of first calling the former screen)
